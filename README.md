# Guitar Practice Tracker (v1)

Hi! This is the **first public version** of my **guitar practice tracker**. I’ve been using it personally for quite a while and have already seen **real results**.

I got tired of keeping practice notes in random places (**iPhone Notes**, etc.), so I built an app that **automatically records** my practice data in a **clean and convenient format**.  
The workout log format is designed to be easy to read in **Obsidian** (I love keeping **stats**).

As a friend once told me:  
> **“If you can measure something, you can improve it.”**

If you’re struggling to stay **consistent** or to see **progress** in your guitar exercises, this app might help.

## **What can the tracker do right now?**

### **1) Manage your exercises**
Go to **Manage Exercises** to create your own exercises and organize them into **folders**.  
You can easily move exercises between folders using **drag & drop**.

Each exercise supports:
- **Charts / statistics by day** (see your progress over time)
- **BPM tracking** (daily BPM values + your **personal record**)
- A **link** to the exercise (YouTube, tabs, article, etc.)
- A short **note**

> **UI note:** the design is still **rough** — I’d really appreciate feedback.  
> Building and designing alone is hard, so your suggestions will help a lot.

### **2) Workout History**
In **Workout History** you can see a **daily summary** of your practice sessions.  
It’s a quick and convenient way to review what you practiced each day.

At the bottom, you can also see the **total amount of time** you’ve spent practicing overall.

---

### **3) Settings**
For now, **Settings** includes an **inactivity indicator**:
- An exercise gets a **red marker** if you haven’t practiced it in a while  
This helps you avoid forgetting important exercises.

## **Start a new workout**
Click **New Workout**, pick an exercise, enable the built-in **metronome** (if you need it), and start practicing.  
The app will track your workout and update your **statistics** automatically.

## **Feedback**
I’d love your feedback. I put a lot of effort into building this, but I know it’s still an **early / raw version**.  
If you have ideas about **features**, **UX**, or **design improvements** — please share them!
