##**Guitar Practice Tracker (v1)**

Hi! This is the first public version of my guitar practice tracker. I’ve been using it personally for quite a while and have already seen real results.

I got tired of keeping practice notes in random places (iPhone Notes, etc.), so I built an app that automatically records my practice data in a clean and convenient format. The workout log format is designed to be easy to read in Obsidian (I love keeping stats).

As a friend once told me:

“If you can measure something, you can improve it.”

If you’re struggling to stay consistent or to see progress in your guitar exercises, this app might help.

What can the tracker do right now?
1) Manage your exercises

Go to Manage Exercises to create your own exercises and organize them into folders.
You can easily move exercises between folders using drag & drop.

Each exercise supports:

Charts / statistics by day (progress over time)

BPM tracking (your daily BPM values + personal record)

A link to the exercise (e.g., YouTube, tabs, article)

A short note

Yes, the UI is still rough — I’d really appreciate feedback. Designing alone is hard, and I’d love suggestions on how to make it look and feel better.

2) Workout History

In Workout History you can see a simple daily summary of your practice sessions.
It’s a quick, convenient way to review what you did each day.

3) Settings

For now, Settings includes an “inactivity indicator”:

An exercise gets a red marker if you haven’t practiced it in a while
This helps you avoid forgetting important exercises.

Start a new workout

Click New Workout, pick an exercise, enable the built-in metronome (if you need it), and start practicing.
The app will track your workout and update your stats automatically.

Feedback

I’d love your feedback. I put a lot of effort into building this, but I know it’s still an early and raw version.
If you have ideas on features, UX, or design improvements — please share them!
